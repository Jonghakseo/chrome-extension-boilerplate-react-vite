### Add New Script

1. Copy `matches/example` folder and paste it with other name or make folder manually, but you need to be sure
   `index.ts` is included.

2. Edit `manifest.ts`:
- In `content-scripts` section add object with:

```ts
{
  matches: ['URL_FOR_INJECT'], 
  js: ['content/{matches_folder_name}.iife.js']
}
```
